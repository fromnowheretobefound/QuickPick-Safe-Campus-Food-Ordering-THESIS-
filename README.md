# QuickPick-Safe-Campus-Food-Ordering-THESIS(2022)
A digital food ordering system that lets students order meals online and pick them up at semi-isolated spots on campus like lockers or empty rooms, reducing canteen crowding and promoting social distancing.


About Project

The Touchless Smart Canteen System is a web-based food ordering and delivery platform developed using PHP, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and CSS. It includes two main interfaces: user side and admin panel. The system is designed for school campuses to minimize physical contact and promote social distancing. Students can order food online and have it delivered to designated semi-isolated pickup spots on campus, such as lockers, empty classrooms, or outdoor tables.

On the user side, students can access the homepage, about page, food menu, order tracking, and contact page. They can easily place orders and receive notifications when their food is ready for pickup. The goal is to eliminate long queues and reduce congestion in canteens.
About System

When launched, the system opens to a responsive web interface tailored for student use. The admin has full control over operations through the admin panel. Admin functionalities include user management, pickup location assignments, menu updates, and site settings.

The admin can:

    Approve or manage users

    Add or update food items on the menu

    Assign available pickup points

    Edit pages like “About Us”, “Welcome Message”, and “Instructions”

    View daily or monthly order reports

This setup allows real-time updates and centralized control without editing code manually. The clean dashboard design helps administrators and food vendors manage the system efficiently.
